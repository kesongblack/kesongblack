- 👋🏽 Hi, I’m Kris. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cross-platform development and automation, but my work seems to incline me to project management and policy-making (which I'm not good at tbh, but I need it for my payroll 😵‍💫).
- 📦 Most of my projects posted here are for web and mobile (Android, since I don't own iOS), using JavaScript and Dart/Flutter. Sometimes Laravel/Inertia(Vue, and python if it requires me to do so.
- ✍ I also do a bit of writing/encoding here, and a bit of photo-video editing there, whenever what work warrants me to do, I always strive to meet the tasks being thrown to me with quality.
- 📫 How to reach me ... just contact me here: kesongblack@proton.me (or maybe send a message here if it exist?)
