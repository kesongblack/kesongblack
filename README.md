- 👋 Hi, I’m @kesongblack. 🧀👌🏿
- 👀 I’m interested in learning cross-platform development and automation, but my work seems to incline me to project management (which I'm not good at tbh 😵‍💫).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development thru VueJS and a dip of a python for small automations. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... just contact me here: kesongblack@proton.me (or maybe send a message here if it exist?)
